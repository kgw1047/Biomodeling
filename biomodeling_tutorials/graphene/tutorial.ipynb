    "- Graphene is a promising material due to its interesting physical and chemical properties such as electrical conductivity and mechanical durability.\n",

    "    - Definitely, electrical conductivity requires QM treatments.\n",
    "- A typical application of graphene is the nanopore instrument. \n",
